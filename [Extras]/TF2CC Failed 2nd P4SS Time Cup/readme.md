## Tournament Files

These are the files that were used by me during the TF2CC's 2nd 4v4 PASS Time Cup. The cup was a failure, bringing in 6 teams, 2 of which who baited on match day to go play Highlander scrims, and one team that didn't even show up. 72 people reacted to see the PASS Time Cup channels, 63 reacted for pugs. Pugs were only ran once by me, which had to be filled with Masters+ from the 4v4 PASS Time Discord. Four other attempts to run pugs were made. Only two people attended the class that PND4 gave (video is [here](https://youtu.be/b4NJgrJBXdg?si=hEnfl5I1i-7rnjoI)). The files are archived here so as to not waste all the effort that was put in to create them, in hopes that a future tournament may be ran.
